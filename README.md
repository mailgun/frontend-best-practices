# Mailgun Frontend Best Practices
This repo contains many coding style guides for frontend developers. The intent of these documents is to reduce the number of choices a developer has to make while also educating the developer about why one pattern might be preferred over another. This allows them to focus on the program's logic instead of making style decisions. Ultimately, this results in cleaner, less-error-prone, and more predictable code.
